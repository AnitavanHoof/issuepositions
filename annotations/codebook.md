# Code book for stance detection

We define a stance as a textual expression which allows the reader to position the actor on an ideological dimension (cf. Du Bois). This can be an explicit expression of a preference (Biden is in favor of abortion access), but it can also be a more implicit expression of ideology, for example an evaluation of a policy or state of affairs (e.g. Johnson says Brexit deal 'does not take back control’); a legislative action or proposal (Labour proposes a new ombudsman for gambling industry); or even a symbolic action such as joining a protest or visiting a plant (e.g. MP joins protest at abortion clinic, or Biden says he'll wear mask in public). 
The guiding question to determine whether something is an issue position or not, is whether an average reader would be able to place that actor on an issue dimension based on the given text, e.g. without relying on external political knowledge. The provided context can be used to understand references within the target text, e.g. if it explains what a particular plan or proposal means – see below for example sentences.

Note that in one sentence more issue positions can be mentioned (Both the Greens and Labour  vote for abortion access).

We have determined issues based on the Comparative Agenda Project (CAP; https://www.comparativeagendas.net) but rephrased in order to provide each issue with a dimension where it is clear what the actor is in favour of or opposing against. Underneath we discuss the topics from the CAP and what our labelling will be including the direction the stance can have. We also provide examples and when applicable include Dutch examples/issues 

## **Health care**: Better accesible health care
This topic deals with investments in health care and to make health care more accessible for everybody, e.g. by abandoning the deductible ('eigen risico'). 

## **Agriculture**: **In favor of intensive agriculture**. 
This topic deals with the farmers. In favor of the farmers means in favor of intensive argigulture and against nitrogen reduction (stikstofreductie).

## **Energy**: **Investment in energy transiation**
Within this topic we look at who is in favor of investments in the transition of energy from fossil fuels to renewable fuels.
Nuclear energy is within this issue coded as an investment in the transition to renewable fuels.

## **Defense**: Strong defense/NATO
Within this issue we oppose the actors in favor of more investment in Defense and the expense standard of 2% for the national gross product for Defense as NATO wants.

## **Government Operations**: improved governance through reforms
In the CAP this isssue is wider, but within our context we focus on an improved governance through different reforms, but also focusing on transparancy ('beter bestuur') and improving trust in governmental bodies.

## **Social welfare**: More social security
The topic social welfare is expecially focusing on social security for everybody for example by linking benefits to the minimum wages and indexing pensions.

## **Labor**: More and better work
"Work should pay off" (Werken moet lonen) is the focus of this topic, hence parties that are in favor of work are in favor of a higher minium wage and better labor conditions for employees.

## **Transportation**: Investments in roads and public transport
When looking at transportation issues we look at investments for better roads or investments for public transport. Also an increase in highway speedlimmits means you are in favor of transport. 

## **Immigration**: More or less immigrants
This topic deals with the question if a party wants stricter immigartion policies or not. In this respect it is not only about refugees but also about labor immigrants or about foreign students. 

## **International Affairs**: Human rights and international law 
When considering international affairs we focus on the distinction to be in favor of development aid and a focus on human rights and international law as a basis for foreign policy versus a focus on teh national interests as starting point for international relations.

## **Education**: More investments in Education  and science (Technology)
The topic education focusses on more and better eduction. Measures to counter the shortage of teachers for example is an investment in education. The same is true for extra money with respect to science and technology.

## **Culture**: More investments in Culture
An actor is in favor of more culture when investments are proposed, e.g. free entrance to museums for specific groups of people. One is not in favor of more Culture when in favor of a VAT increase for cultural events.

## **Civil rights**: In favor of civil rights (gay etc)
Civil rights are dealing with equal rights for all people in society, despite the color of their skin or their gender. 

## **Government spending**: Less taxes, economy first
Government spending is an issue that is not mentioned in the CAP but is important within a Dutch political context, and probably also during other election campaigns. It deals with a focus on austerity measures in order to keep control on govermental spending versus more investments and a higher governmental deficit.

## **Environment**: Protecting the environment
In our coding we focus on the protection of the environment within this topic, while for example a focus on wind energy is covered within the topic energy. Here topics deal with investments in more nature, or policy in order to reduce trash, like deposit on cans.

## **Housing**: Affordable houses / more houses
When in favor of more houses, an actor want either to build more houses, or want houses to be affordable for everybody, for example with policies to discourage people to buy a house where they are not living themselves.

## **Law and Crime**: Fight crime, harsher penalties, counter-terrorism
This topics deals with law and order and in favor one wants repressive measures in order to fight crime, while more prevention is seen as opposed to more law and order. 

## **European Union**: Liberal world order including EU
The topic about the European order deals not only with the question if one is in favor of (more) EU but also if one is focusing on a liberal world order as a basis for trade and international relationships.
